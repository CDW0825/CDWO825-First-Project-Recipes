    <h2> I have made this potato soup for many whom have given it this title. It takes a bit of effort but is well worth it. Please note: for those who do not wish to use bacon, substitute 1/4 cup melted butter for the bacon grease and continue with the recipe. (I generally serve this soup as a special treat as it is not recommended for people counting calories.)</h2>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1 pound bacon, chopped</li>
            <li>2 stalk celery=, diced</li>
            <li>1 onion, chopped</li>
            <li>3 cloves garlic, minced</li>
            <li>8 potatoes, peeled and cubed</li>
            <li>4 cups of chicken stock, or enough to cover potatoes</li>
            <li>3 tablespoons butter</li>
            <li>1/4 cup all purpose flour</li>
            <li>1 cup heavy cream</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon dried tarragon</li>
            <li>3 teaspoons chopped fresh cilantro</li>
            <li>salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Directions</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Step 1
                    <ul>Place bacon in a Dutch oven and cook over medium-high heat, turning occasionally, until evenly browned, 5 to 10 minutes. Drain bacon pieces on paper towels. Drain off all but 1/4 cup of the bacon grease.</ul>
                </li>
                <li>Step 2
                    <ul>Cook celery and onion in the reserved bacon drippings until onion is soft and translucent, about 5 minutes. Stir in garlic, and continue cooking for 1 to 2 minutes. Add cubed potatoes, and toss to coat. Saute for 3 to 4 minutes. Return bacon to the pan, and add enough chicken stock to just cover the potatoes. Cover, and simmer until potatoes are tender, 15 to 20 minutes. </ul>
                </li>
                <li>Step 3
                    <ul>Transfer about 1/2 of the soup to a blender and puree. Return to the Dutch oven. Adjust seasonings to taste. </ul>            
                </li>
            </ol>
