    <h2>What is a Butchers Steak</h2>
        <p><strong><em>Butchers Steak</em></strong>This butcher or hanger steak recipe is great pan-cooked, broiled, or grilled. It takes to marinade wonderfully and really can be substituted for any cut of steak. Just be sure to take the time to trim it well.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients you need to make a Butchers Steak</h3>  
        <ul>    
            <li>(2 pound) butcher's steak (hanger steak) </li>
            <li>salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste </li>
            <li>1 tablespoon clarified butter</li>
            <li>â…” cup chicken broth</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons balsamic vinegar</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons cold butter, cut into cubes</li>
            <li>salt to taste</li>
        </ul>    
    <h3>Directions</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Step 1
                <ul>Remove all silver skin and extra fat from steak. Carefully cut out the connective tissue that connects the 2 halves of the steak, separating the whole into 2 long pieces. Cut lobe of meat from one half (it's a piece that is slightly separated from the larger half). Then cut each of the 2 larger halves into 2 steaks each. Sprinkle with salt and pepper. </ul>
            <li>Step 2
                <ul>Heat skillet over high heat. Add clarified butter when pan is hot, then place the steaks in the pan. Reduce heat to medium. Cook until browned on all sides, firm, and reddish-pink on the inside. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read 125 degrees F (52 degrees C), a total of about 12 minutes. (This cut of meat has a sort of triangular shape, so about 4 minutes per side.) Transfer to a warm plate and tent with foil to let steaks rest and allow temperature to rise to 130 degrees F.</ul>
            </li>        
        </ol>
